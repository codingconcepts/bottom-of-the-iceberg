# bottom-of-the-iceberg

This is the code that backs [Bottom of the Iceberg](https://bottomoftheiceberg.com).

Like many metalheads, I love to discover new and terrifying metal with the help of iceberg charts. To give back to the metal community, me and [Paul Scanlon](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon) have created this iceberg _site_ that can be built up over time.

Think of it as a shared journey to the most vile and crushing depths of music. All of us, discovering as we go.
