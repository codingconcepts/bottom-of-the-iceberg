# bottom-of-the-iceberg

This is the code that backs [Bottom of the Iceberg](https://bottomoftheiceberg.com).

Feel free to contribute by submitting your own tracks/suggestions and, together, we'll decend to the depths of extreme metal; discovering new bands as we go.

### Todos

* General UI/UX tart up

* Use Metal Mania font for title
* Fix bundling (ignores title and Metal Mania font)
* Country flags
* Better track titles (including subgenres)
